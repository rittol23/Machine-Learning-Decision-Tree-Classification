# Machine-Learning-Decision-Tree-Classification
The project code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The main algorithm used is the decision tree classifier, which is a popular and effective machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. The project uses the "Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" dataset, which is available on Kaggle. DISCLAIMER:  Project not for medical diagnosis/treatment!!!
